Servo breakout for RPi 0/1/2 based on the [servoblaster](https://github.com/richardghirst/PiBits/tree/master/ServoBlaster)/pi-blaster software. This board supports the default location of 8 servos. In most cases it passively wires the servos to the right pins with shared power and ground rails. A level shifter can be added if your servos require a logic pulse above the RPi's 3.3V. The board is small to reduce cost and fit on both Pi 1 and Pi 0.

You'll need a stacking female 2x13 header to connect to the RPi, commonly found at [Adafruit](https://www.adafruit.com/products/1112) or [Toby Electronics](http://www.toby.co.uk/content/catalogue/products.aspx?series=REF-18xxxx-0x). This header can be soldered directly to the board or fed into a [bottom-entry SMT header](http://www.toby.co.uk/content/catalogue/products.aspx?series=REF-1826xx-0x) soldered onto the top.
